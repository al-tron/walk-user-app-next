You may have noticed that the {{SITE_NAME}} website/app doesn't display a cookie banner asking for various permissions on your first visit.

This is because as a hard rule we respect your privacy and do not track you. We also do not collect your data, or store cookies on your device in any way, shape or form except for a few very specific cases where it is truly necessary for the functionality of the website/app or to provide you with a service.

All of the cases where we may store your personal data or add a cookie to your device are listed below:

## Log In With Google

When you sign up for an account on {{SITE_NAME}} via Google OAuth, we collect and store some personal information, this is provided to us by Google and includes: Your name, email address, language preference, and a link to your Google profile picture.

We use this information to create your user account which enables us to present you with a more personalised experience. Having a user account also allows you to make use of our user specific services such as ticking off hills you've climbed.

Our authentication system stores a session cookie on your device. This session cookie is essential for maintaining your logged-in status and ensuring a seamless user experience across different pages of the website/app.

You can remove this cookie from your device at any time simply by logging out via the "log out" button, this will delete the cookie.

This cookie will also be removed, and you will be logged out from the website/app, if you delete your browser data.

## Contact Form

When you fill out our contact form and submit an enquiry we will receive an email to our inbox containing all of the information and contact details you have willingly submitted to us.

We use these details so that we can take action and respond to your email effectively. These emails, including our responses, may be stored in order to help us with any future enquiries that we may receive from you.

You can request that any emails you have sent us via the contact form are deleted from our inbox at any time by, getting in touch via the contact form.

After actioning your request we will also delete your email requesting deletion and the confirmation email we'll send after.

## Unit Select Toggle Switch

By default we use the metric system (km | m) across this website/app when displaying things such as the distance or altitude data of a walk.

If you would prefer to see the imperial system (miles | ft) used across the website/app you can opt to do so.

On smaller screens such as a mobile phone the unit select toggle switch is towards the bottom of the main menu, which can be accessed by clicking the menu button in the top-right of the website/app.

On larger screens such as a laptop the unit select toggle switch can be accessed by clicking on the settings icon that appears towards the top-right of the website/app.

If you opt to use the imperial system, the website/app will store a very simple cookie ("isImperial": "true") on your device in order to remember your choice for future visits from that device and browser so that you don't have to manually select your preferred units each time.

You can remove this cookie from your device at any time simply by reverting back to the metric system (km | m) using the unit select toggle switch, this will delete the cookie and the website/app will once again use the metric system.

This cookie will also be removed, and the website/app will forget your choice, if you delete your browser data.

## Light/Dark Theme

As part of making our website/app as accessible and comfortable to use for as many people as possible we have implemented an option to change the theme between light and dark colour schemes.

On smaller screens such as a mobile phone the theme options are right at the bottom of the main menu, which can be accessed by clicking the menu button in the top-right of the website/app.

On larger screens such as a laptop the light/dark menu can be accessed by clicking on the sun or moon icon that appears at the very top-right of the website/app.

If you haven't selected an option, the website/app respects your system's default setting. For example, if you have your smart phone set to dark mode the website/app should already be in dark mode without changing or selecting anything, and vice versa.

If you select "Dark" or "Light" the website/app will display the chosen colour scheme irrespective of your system settings. When one of these options is selected the website/app will store a very simple cookie ("theme: dark" or "theme: light") on your device in order to remember your choice for future visits from that device and browser so that you don't have to manually select your preferred colour scheme each time.

You can remove this cookie from your device at any time simply by selecting "Default" from the theme selector menu, this will delete the cookie and the website/app will respect your system theme settings once again.

This cookie will also be removed, and the website/app will forget your choice, if you delete your browser data.

## Third party links

On occasion we may include links to third parties on this website/app. Where we provide a link it does not mean that we endorse or approve that site's policy towards visitor privacy. You should review their privacy policy as well.
